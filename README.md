# DNDCharacter
Randomly spawn a level 1 D&amp;D character 

After seeing one of the projects based on a D&D character, I wanted to create a class that would randomly generate a new D&D character. Being a dungeon master myself, there are times when I need to create characters on moment's notice or new player's not knowing how to create one, or just one-shot adventures where the character's you are using are only going to be one time things.
